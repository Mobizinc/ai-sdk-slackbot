  üéØ What Will Change in Production When You Merge

  Immediate Impacts:

  1. Database changes required - 3 new migrations must run
  2. New cron jobs will activate - Case queue monitoring, leaderboard, snapshots
  3. AI model switch - From AI Gateway to Anthropic API with caching
  4. New service categories - AI will start classifying service portfolios
  5. Catalog redirect - New routing logic for catalog requests
  6. HR detection - Automated HR case identification
  7. CMDB reconciliation - Automated asset linking

  Configuration Needed:

  - Environment variables for Anthropic API
  - Cron job schedules in Vercel
  - GitHub branch protection rules
  - Separate database URLs for dev/staging/prod

  Data Considerations:

  - Massive backup data adds ~700k lines to repo
  - Test data may exist in staging database
  - Scripts directory grew from minimal to 200+ files

  üìã Recommended Action Plan

  Before merging staging ‚Üí main, you should:

  1. Review database migrations - Ensure they're safe for production
  2. Check environment variables - Anthropic API keys, database URLs
  3. Test cron jobs - Verify they work in staging first
  4. Review backup data inclusion - Decide if you want all that data in main
  5. Update documentation - Ensure README reflects current state
  6. Notify team - About workflow changes and new branch structure
  7. Prepare rollback plan - In case issues arise
