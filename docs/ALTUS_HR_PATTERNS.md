## 🚀 Implementation Recommendations

### 1. Update Custom Catalog Mappings (Immediate)
Run the update script with enhanced keywords:
```bash
npx tsx --env-file=.env.local scripts/update-altus-catalog-mappings.ts
```

### 2. Enhance HR Request Detector (Short-term)
Add pattern matching for:
- Subject line templates
- Structured field detection (Name:, Hire Date:, etc.)
- Sender patterns (Brian Wallace for terminations)

### 3. Add Confidence Boosters (Short-term)
Increase confidence scores when:
- Subject matches known patterns
- Sender matches known submitters
- Body contains signature patterns

### 4. Create Feedback Loop (Long-term)
Track:
- False positives (non-HR cases redirected)
- False negatives (HR cases not redirected)
- User compliance (resubmissions via catalog)
