# Session Notes: Service Portfolio Classification & Workflow Setup

**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Session Type:** Feature Implementation + Infrastructure Setup
**Status:** ✅ Complete (pending production cleanup)

---

## Executive Summary

This session implemented three critical fixes for Service Portfolio Classification and established a complete dev → staging → prod workflow with proper database branching.

### What Was Accomplished

1. ✅ **Service Portfolio Classification** - AI now correctly identifies and stores Service Offerings and Application Services
2. ✅ **Database Schema Migration** - Added columns to support service portfolio fields
3. ✅ **Dev/Staging/Prod Workflow** - Complete branch strategy with GitHub Actions
4. ✅ **Comprehensive Documentation** - CONTRIBUTING.md, DEPLOYMENT.md, CHANGELOG.md

### What Needs Cleanup

1. ⚠️ **Production Database** - Contains test data (case SCS0TEST001)
2. ⚠️ **ServiceNow Records** - Two test Problem records (PRB0040124, PRB0040125)
3. ⚠️ **Environment Variables** - Need to pull dev/staging URLs from Vercel

---

## Technical Deep Dive

### Problem Statement

**User reported:** "but there wasn't an application called gorev it was 'Altus Application - GoRev'"

**Root cause:** The AI was correctly identifying both `service_offering` and `application_service` in the JSON response, but these values weren't being saved to dedicated database columns. Only the raw JSON was stored.

**Impact:** Could not query or report on service portfolio classification. The fields were "lost" in the JSON blob.

---

## The Three Fixes

### Fix #1: Database Schema Changes

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/db/schema.ts` - Added columns to both tables
- `scripts/add-service-offering-columns.sql` - Migration SQL

**Changes to `case_classification_results` table:**
```typescript
export const caseClassificationResults = pgTable(
  "case_classification_results",
  {
    // ... existing fields ...
    confidenceScore: real("confidence_score").notNull(),
    retryCount: integer("retry_count").default(0).notNull(),
    createdAt: timestamp("created_at").defaultNow().notNull(),
    // Service Portfolio Classification (NEW)
    serviceOffering: text("service_offering"),
    applicationService: text("application_service"),
  },
  // ... indexes ...
);
```

**Changes to `case_classifications` table:**
```typescript
export const caseClassifications = pgTable(
  "case_classifications",
  {
    // ... existing fields ...
    workNoteContent: text("work_note_content"),
    // Service Portfolio Classification (NEW)
    serviceOffering: text("service_offering"),
    applicationService: text("application_service"),
  },
  // ... indexes ...
);
```

**Migration SQL executed on production:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE case_classifications
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS service_offering TEXT;

ALTER TABLE case_classifications
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS application_service TEXT;

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_service_offering
ON case_classifications(service_offering);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_application_service
ON case_classifications(application_service);
```

**Status:** ✅ Applied to production, ⚠️ Needs to be applied to dev/staging via Vercel

---

### Fix #2: Code Changes (The Critical Missing Piece)

**Problem:** There were TWO calls to `saveClassificationResult()` in the codebase, but only ONE was updated.

**First Call** - `lib/services/case-classifier.ts:283`
```typescript
await this.repository.saveClassificationResult({
  caseNumber: caseData.case_number,
  workflowId: routingResult.workflowId,
  classificationJson: classification,
  // ... other fields ...
  confidenceScore: classification.confidence_score,
  retryCount: 0,
  // Service Portfolio Classification (NEW)
  serviceOffering: classification.service_offering,
  applicationService: classification.application_service,
});
```

**Second Call** - `lib/services/case-triage.ts:983-985` (THIS WAS THE MISSING PIECE!)
```typescript
const resultData: NewCaseClassificationResults = {
  caseNumber: data.caseNumber,
  workflowId: data.workflowId,
  classificationJson: data.classification,
  // ... other fields ...
  confidenceScore: data.classification.confidence_score || 0,
  retryCount: 0,
  // Service Portfolio Classification (NEW) - ADDED IN THIS SESSION
  serviceOffering: data.classification.service_offering,
  applicationService: data.classification.application_service,
};

await this.repository.saveClassificationResult(resultData);
```

**Why this matters:** The second call in `case-triage.ts` was overwriting the first save without the new fields, causing them to be NULL in the database even though they were in the JSON.

**Status:** ✅ Fixed and tested

---

### Fix #3: Testing & Verification

**Test Script:** `scripts/test-altus-gorev-case.ts`

**Test Case Details:**
```typescript
{
  case_number: 'SCS0TEST001',
  company: 'c3eec28c931c9a1049d9764efaba10f3', // Altus Community Healthcare
  short_description: 'Users unable to access GoRev application',
  description: '15+ users affected, authentication failure...'
}
```

**Why Altus Community Healthcare?**
- Has 24 application services configured in DEV/PROD
- Includes "Altus Health - Gorev Production" application service
- Perfect for testing dynamic application service loading

**AI Response:**
```json
{
  "category": "Application",
  "subcategory": "GoRev Authentication",
  "confidence_score": 0.95,
  "service_offering": "Application Administration",
  "application_service": "Altus Health - Gorev Production"
}
```

**Database Verification:**
```sql
SELECT
  case_number,
  service_offering,
  application_service,
  confidence_score
FROM case_classification_results
WHERE case_number = 'SCS0TEST001';

-- Result:
-- case_number  | service_offering            | application_service
-- SCS0TEST001  | Application Administration  | Altus Health - Gorev Production
```

**Status:** ✅ Verified working correctly

## Service Portfolio Architecture

### The 5 Service Offerings

1. **Infrastructure and Cloud Management**
   - Server maintenance (physical/virtual/cloud)
   - Asset tracking, warranty management
   - License tracking

2. **Network Management**
   - Routers, switches, wireless networks
   - VoIP systems, Internet/Broadband
   - Vendor coordination, failover redundancy

3. **Cybersecurity Management**
   - Security monitoring, firewall management
   - VPN management, endpoint security
   - Threat assessments

4. **Helpdesk and Endpoint Support**
   - 24/7 user support (phone/email)
   - Endpoint device management
   - Tiered support (Tier 1-3), onsite dispatch

5. **Application Administration** ⭐
   - Administrative support for company-specific applications
   - Patch management, incident coordination
   - **Dynamic application list per company**

### Dynamic Application Services

**How it works:**
1. Case comes in with company sys_id
2. System queries ServiceNow `cmdb_ci_service` table for company's applications
3. Applications are injected into AI prompt dynamically
4. AI identifies specific application from company's portfolio
5. Both Service Offering and Application Service are saved to database

**Example:**
- **Company:** Altus Community Healthcare
- **Applications:** 24 configured (GoRev, NextGen, O365, etc.)
- **Case mentions:** "GoRev authentication issue"
- **AI identifies:** Service Offering = "Application Administration", Application Service = "Altus Health - Gorev Production"

**Code Location:** `lib/services/case-triage.ts:274-308`

## Workflow Setup

### Branch Structure (Before → After)

**Before:**
```
main (production)
  ├── Development (mixed dev/staging)
  └── feature/* (ad-hoc)
```

**After:**
```
main (production)
  ↑
staging (pre-production)
  ↑
dev (active development)
  ↑
feature/* (isolated features)
```

### Branch Renaming Executed

```bash
# Step 1: Rename local branch
git branch -m Development staging

# Step 2: Push new branch and delete old
git push origin staging
git push origin --delete Development

# Step 3: Set upstream
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/staging staging

# Step 4: Create dev branch
git checkout -b dev
git push -u origin dev
```

**Status:** ✅ Complete, branches renamed and pushed

## Production Pollution Details

### What Got Polluted

1. **Database Records:**
   - Table: `case_classification_inbound` - 2 records
   - Table: `case_classification_results` - 2 records
   - Table: `case_discovered_entities` - ~250 records

2. **ServiceNow Records:**
   - Problem PRB0040124 (first test)
   - Problem PRB0040125 (second test, after rebuild)
   - Both linked to non-existent case SCS0TEST001

### Why It Happened

- Only one `DATABASE_URL` configured (production)
- No `DEV_DATABASE_URL` or `STAGING_DATABASE_URL` set
- Test scripts used production database by default
- Migrations ran against production Neon branch

### How to Clean Up

**Step 1: Database Cleanup**
```bash
# Dry run first
pnpm tsx scripts/cleanup-test-data.ts --dry-run

# Review output, then confirm
pnpm tsx scripts/cleanup-test-data.ts --confirm
```

**Step 2: ServiceNow Cleanup (Manual)**
1. Go to ServiceNow production instance
2. Search for: PRB0040124, PRB0040125
3. Close or delete both Problem records
4. Document in comments: "Test records from development"

**Status:** ⚠️ Pending (cleanup script ready, not yet executed)

## Key Learnings

### What Went Right ✅

1. **Systematic debugging** - Checked database, traced through logs, found the second save call
2. **Comprehensive testing** - Used actual company data (Altus) with real applications
3. **Proper documentation** - Created guides for future developers
4. **Version control** - Proper git workflow with clear commit messages

### What Could Be Better ⚠️

1. **Environment separation** - Should have had dev/staging databases from start
2. **Test data management** - Should have used dev environment for testing
3. **Schema changes** - Should have tested on dev branch first before production

### Best Practices Established 🎯

1. **Always use feature branches** - Never commit directly to main/staging/dev
2. **Test migrations on dev first** - Use isolated database branches
3. **Document as you go** - Don't wait until the end
4. **Verify database changes** - Always check what was actually saved
5. **Clean up after yourself** - Don't leave test data in production
