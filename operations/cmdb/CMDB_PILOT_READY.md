## üöÄ Quick Start (3 Options)

### Option 1: Guided Workflow (Recommended)

```bash
# Run the interactive Phase 1 script
./scripts/cmdb-pilot-phase1.sh
```

This will:
1. Check prerequisites
2. Run infrastructure discovery
3. Guide you through creating 3 CI records
4. Validate your work
5. Show next steps

### Option 2: Manual Step-by-Step

```bash
# 1. Test your setup
npx tsx scripts/test-pilot-setup.ts

# 2. Discover infrastructure from Slack
npx tsx scripts/discover-infrastructure.ts --channel altus-support --days 60

# 3. Review the discovery report
ls -lt infrastructure-discovery-*.json | head -1

# 4. Create CI records manually
# Use: templates/cmdb-ci-template.json
# See: examples/altus-file-server-example.json
# Save to: ci-records/altus-[name].json

# 5. Validate your CI records
npx tsx scripts/validate-ci.ts ci-records/*.json

# 6. Upload to ServiceNow (your choice of method)

# 7. Test with PeterPool in Slack
```

### Option 3: Just Explore

```bash
# Read the plan
cat operations/cmdb/CMDB_PILOT_ALTUS.md

# Check the quick reference
cat operations/cmdb/CMDB_TOOLS_SUMMARY.md

# Look at the example
cat examples/altus-file-server-example.json

# Review the template
cat templates/cmdb-ci-template.json
```

## ‚úÖ Testing Results

All infrastructure has been validated:

### File Structure Tests
- ‚úÖ All 4 documentation files created
- ‚úÖ Templates and examples created
- ‚úÖ All 7 scripts created
- ‚úÖ `ci-records/` directory ready
- ‚úÖ Scripts are executable

### Validation Tests
- ‚úÖ CI template has valid JSON schema
- ‚úÖ Example CI passes validation with 100/100 score
- ‚úÖ Template includes all required fields
- ‚úÖ Example demonstrates best practices

### Integration Tests
Require environment configuration:
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Slack connection (needs SLACK_BOT_TOKEN)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è ServiceNow connection (needs credentials)

**To test your environment:**
```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-pilot-setup.ts
```

## üìã Phase 1 Checklist

Use this to track your progress through Phase 1:

### Preparation
- [ ] Review `operations/cmdb/CMDB_PILOT_ALTUS.md`
- [ ] Configure `.env.local` with Slack and ServiceNow credentials
- [ ] Run `npx tsx scripts/test-pilot-setup.ts` - all tests pass
- [ ] Schedule 1-2 hour inventory session

### Discovery (30 minutes)
- [ ] Run infrastructure discovery script
- [ ] Review JSON report
- [ ] Identify 3 CIs to document (different types)

### Documentation (1-2 hours)
- [ ] Create CI record #1 (File Server - 10.252.0.40)
- [ ] Create CI record #2 (Network Device or Application)
- [ ] Create CI record #3 (Different type)
- [ ] Validate all 3 records (90+ score each)
- [ ] Fix any validation errors

### ServiceNow Upload
- [ ] Choose import method (manual, CSV, or API)
- [ ] Upload 3 CI records to ServiceNow
- [ ] Verify records appear in CMDB

### Testing
- [ ] Test PeterPool finds CI #1 by IP
- [ ] Test PeterPool finds CI #1 by name
- [ ] Test PeterPool finds CI #1 by common term (e.g., "L drive")
- [ ] Test PeterPool finds CI #2
- [ ] Test PeterPool finds CI #3

### Lessons Learned
- [ ] Document what was easy
- [ ] Document what was hard
- [ ] Document what information was missing
- [ ] Note template improvements needed
- [ ] Share feedback

## üéì What You'll Learn

By completing Phase 1, you'll understand:

1. **What makes CI records useful** for troubleshooting
   - Which fields matter most
   - How to write for AI searchability
   - What tribal knowledge to capture

2. **How infrastructure discovery works**
   - What can be auto-detected from Slack
   - What requires manual input
   - How to prioritize what to document

3. **How PeterPool searches CMDB**

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Summary

| Tool | Purpose | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `cmdb-pilot-phase1.sh` | Guided workflow | Starting Phase 1 |
| `discover-infrastructure.ts` | Find undocumented infra | Beginning of each phase |
| `validate-ci.ts` | Check CI quality | Before ServiceNow upload |

## üîç Key Success Factors

### For AI Searchability

**Good tags include:**
- IP addresses: `"10.252.0.40"`
- Common names: `"L drive"`, `"Altus share"`
- UNC paths: `"altus.share"`
- Error keywords: `"access denied"`, `"permission issues"`

**Good purpose descriptions:**
- Explain WHAT it is
- Explain WHY it exists
- Explain WHO uses it
- Explain WHAT breaks if down

**Example:**
> "Primary file share for Altus HQ users. Hosts departmental folders, user home directories, and shared resources. Commonly accessed as 'L Drive' via mapped network drive. Critical for daily operations - users store all working files here."

### For Completeness

Aim for:
- ‚úÖ 90+ validation score
- ‚úÖ 5+ searchable tags
- ‚úÖ Detailed purpose (50+ chars)
- ‚úÖ Known issues with workarounds
- ‚úÖ Related case references

---

## üìû Support

### Documentation Issues
- Check `operations/cmdb/CMDB_PILOT_ALTUS.md` for detailed plan

### Script Issues
```bash
# Test environment
