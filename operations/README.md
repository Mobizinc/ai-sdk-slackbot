# Operations Runbooks

This bundle collects the ServiceNow onboarding, CMDB, and production-support playbooks that sit outside the Slack bot implementation. Each subfolder groups the runbooks by the operational workflow they support.

## Directory Map
- `onboarding/` – Azure tenant onboarding and multi-client deployment guides.
- `cmdb/` – CMDB pilot plans, status reports, and relationship automation notes.
- `service-portfolio/` – Service offering definitions and relationship fix summaries.
- `servicenow/` – Webhook and admin setup instructions for ServiceNow teams.
- `deployment/` – Branching workflow, environment checklists, and session notes.
- `integrations/` – External system blueprints (Webex voice, network triage agent).

## How to Use
Start with the README or plan inside the relevant subfolder, then follow the linked scripts or checklists from there. The documents keep their original filenames so any historical references can be updated by prepending `operations/` to the old `docs/` path.
