# CI Relationship Fix - ServiceNow PROD

## Issue Reported
- CI links not visible in ServiceNow CI Relationship Viewer
- Hierarchy appeared broken: Business Service > Service Offering > Application Services

## Root Cause
ServiceNow has **two different relationship mechanisms**:

### 1. Parent Field (What We Had)
- Set on each CI record during creation
- Shows in forms, list views, and API queries
- Creates logical hierarchy
- **Status**: ✅ Was already correct

### 2. CI Relationships (What Was Missing)
- Separate records in `cmdb_rel_ci` table
- Shows in CI Relationship Viewer, dependency maps, relationship graphs
- Required for relationship visualization tools
- **Status**: ❌ Was missing all 30 relationships

## Solution Implemented

Created formal CI Relationship records for the entire hierarchy:
