    "documentation_assessment": "CRITICAL DOCUMENTATION AND STATE ANOMALIES: This change exhibits fundamental disqualifying conditions that prevent CAB evaluation. Primary Issue: Change record shows CLOSED state (state: 3, closed_at: 2025-04-30 09:32:01, close_code: successful) completed 6+ months ago, yet automated validation runs occurred 2025-11-07/08. This indicates either retroactive audit, data corruption, improper record reuse, or failed rollback scenario—context must be established before any assessment proceeds. Documentation Quality: Implementation plan ('Install Update sets') lacks deployment sequence, specific component identification beyond u_update_set field references ('SR; AllCare offboarding request', 'SR; AllCare Update User Cat Item'), duration estimates, and pre-deployment validation steps. Backout plan ('Backout Update sets') provides zero actionable recovery procedures—missing update set sys_ids, revert sequence, validation checkpoints, rollback duration. NO test plan provided (test_plan field empty), eliminating visibility into validation scope, test scenarios, or acceptance criteria. Justification states desired outcome but omits business impact analysis, stakeholder authorization evidence, urgency rationale. Template Configuration: Template shows inactive (active: false), unpublished (published_ref: empty), no workflow attachment despite 100% success rate across 505 changes—suggests deprecated status yet was recently updated 2025-11-05. CMDB environment field undefined creates classification gap. These deficiencies fall catastrophically below the quality standard demonstrated by template's historical success rate.",

      "CRITICAL - CHANGE ALREADY CLOSED: Record shows CLOSED since 2025-04-30 09:32:01 yet being evaluated 2025-11-08 (6+ months post-closure). Indicates either: (1) retroactive audit of implemented change, (2) data integrity corruption, (3) improper record reuse violating change management protocol, or (4) failed rollback requiring reassessment. If already deployed to production, CAB review is meaningless; if record error, state must be corrected before evaluation can proceed.",
      "CRITICAL - CLONE DATA UNAVAILABLE: Clone freshness returns 'not_found' for target instance 'mobizuat'—unable to verify environment readiness. Collection_errors indicates 'Clone info unavailable for target instance'. Historical validation notes reference 554-day clone age (18.4 months stale) for 'mobizdev' instance. Without clone data, cannot confirm update sets developed against current production schema, creating blind deployment scenario with unacceptable compatibility risk and potential for overwriting production customizations.",
      "CRITICAL - NO ACTIONABLE ROLLBACK PLAN: Backout plan limited to generic 'Backout Update sets' eliminates recovery path if deployment corrupts HR offboarding workflows, breaks mailbox access revocation triggers in Exchange/O365 integrations, or introduces description field logic errors affecting active offboarding tickets. Without specific update set revert procedures (sys_ids, sequence), validation steps, rollback duration estimates, production recovery capability completely compromised for critical HR deprovisioning automation.",
      "HIGH - ZERO TEST VALIDATION: Empty test plan means validation approach completely unknown—no evidence that HR offboarding scenarios, shared mailbox revocation workflows, description field population logic, LDAP deprovisioning triggers, or Exchange mailbox delegation removal automation were tested. Template shows 100% success rate, but this submission falls catastrophically below that standard.",
      "HIGH - CRITICAL HR WORKFLOW IMPACT: Modification to offboarding description field logic affects critical HR deprovisioning workflows—risks breaking LDAP listener triggers parsing description text for workflow routing, Exchange/O365 mailbox delegation removal automation dependent on description field values, downstream HR systems consuming description data for identity management platforms, audit/compliance reporting extracting description patterns for offboarding validation and SOX compliance.",
      "HIGH - ENVIRONMENT DRIFT RISK: Update set deployment without confirmed environment refresh risks installing code developed against outdated schema, missing dependencies from intervening platform updates, conflicting with recent shared mailbox catalog item customizations, or overwriting production hotfixes applied since development began.",
      "MEDIUM - DEPRECATED TEMPLATE USAGE: Template shows inactive status (active: false), unpublished state despite 100% success rate across 505 changes—suggests template deprecated or under review. Last updated 2025-11-05 (3 days ago) but remains inactive/unpublished. Questionable whether template shoul"

    "documentation_assessment": "CHG0041592 exhibits fundamental governance violations that make it unapprovable. This change is fraudulently misclassified under the 'ServiceNow Platform Updates' standard template while actually implementing expense management application logic—specifically routing PAK currency expenses from Accounting to HR and deactivating PDF generation. The update set name 'AZ;STRY0011125;Expense Item - sc_task routing + deactivate PDFs generation' and description explicitly confirm application configuration work, not platform maintenance. Implementation plan marked 'N/A' despite requiring business rule modifications and workflow routing changes. Rollback plan completely absent—mandatory for financial workflow changes affecting audit trails and SOX compliance. Test plan marked 'N/A' for changes impacting expense processing and downstream integrations. Justification 'Requested by Igor' provides zero business case, urgency rationale, stakeholder alignment, or compliance consideration. Template producer is inactive (active: false), indicating this template should not accept new changes. Most critically: change state shows '3' (Closed) with 'Successful' close code dated April 24, 2025, yet contains ELEVEN automated rejection work notes spanning November 7-8, 2025—clear evidence of governance bypass, unauthorized implementation, or attempted reactivation without addressing any identified deficiencies. Clone freshness data unavailable ('not_found' status) for mobizuat target instance makes environment validation impossible.",

      "CRITICAL: Template misclassification constitutes governance bypass—'ServiceNow Platform Updates' template has fundamentally different risk profile, review requirements, and approval thresholds than financial application logic modifications affecting expense workflows",
      "CRITICAL: Change already closed with 'Successful' status (April 24, 2025) but contains ELEVEN automated rejection work notes (Nov 7-8, 2025)—represents potential unauthorized implementation or reactivation attempt without remediation; requires immediate audit investigation",
      "CRITICAL: No clone freshness data available for mobizuat target instance—'not_found' status makes environment validation impossible and configuration drift risk unquantifiable",
      "CRITICAL: Zero rollback plan for financial workflow changes—inability to restore routing logic or PDF functionality creates unacceptable risk for financial operations with potential SOX, audit trail, and regulatory compliance implications",

      "HIGH: Accounting team impact unexplored—workload reduction/reallocation, handoff procedures, system access adjustments, process documentation updates, and financial controls modifications not addressed",
      "HIGH: Compliance and audit implications unassessed—currency-specific routing may violate financial controls, segregation of duties principles, regulatory requirements (SOX 404), or audit trail integrity requirements",
