    "documentation_assessment": "CRITICAL DEFICIENCIES: Change CHG0041590 exhibits fundamental disqualifying conditions. The change record shows CLOSED state (state: 3, closed_at: 2025-04-30 09:32:01) yet is being evaluated 2025-11-08 (6+ months post-closure), indicating either retroactive audit, data corruption, or improper record reuse. Documentation quality is severely inadequate: implementation plan ('Install Update sets') lacks deployment sequence, specific component identification, duration estimates, and validation steps. Backout plan ('Backout Update sets') provides zero actionable recovery procedures—missing update set sys_ids, revert sequence, validation checkpoints. NO test plan provided (test_plan field empty). Justification lacks business impact analysis and stakeholder authorization. Template configuration shows inactive (active: false), unpublished (published_ref: empty), no workflow attachment despite 100% historical success rate across 505 changes. CMDB CI environment field undefined. These deficiencies fall catastrophically below the quality standard demonstrated by the template's historical performance.",
    "risks": [
      "CRITICAL - CHANGE ALREADY CLOSED: Record shows CLOSED since 2025-04-30 09:32:01 (successful) yet being evaluated 2025-11-08 (6+ months post-closure). Indicates either: (1) retroactive audit of implemented change, (2) data integrity corruption, (3) improper record reuse violating change management protocol, or (4) failed rollback requiring reassessment. Context must be established before any CAB evaluation can proceed.",
      "CRITICAL - CLONE DATA UNAVAILABLE: Clone freshness check returns 'not_found' for target instance 'mobizuat'. Collection_errors indicates 'Clone info unavailable for target instance mobizuat'. Unable to verify environment readiness or confirm update sets developed against current production schema, creating blind deployment scenario with unacceptable compatibility risk.",
      "CRITICAL - NO ACTIONABLE ROLLBACK PLAN: Backout plan limited to generic 'Backout Update sets' eliminates recovery path if deployment corrupts HR offboarding workflows, breaks mailbox access revocation triggers in Exchange/O365 integrations, or introduces description field logic errors affecting active offboarding tickets. Without specific update set revert procedures (sys_ids, sequence), validation steps, and rollback duration estimates, production recovery capability is completely compromised.",
      "HIGH - ZERO TEST VALIDATION: Empty test plan means validation approach completely unknown—no evidence that HR offboarding scenarios, shared mailbox revocation workflows, description field population logic, LDAP deprovisioning triggers, or Exchange mailbox delegation removal automation were tested. Template shows 100% success rate across 505 changes, but this submission falls catastrophically below that standard.",
      "HIGH - CRITICAL HR WORKFLOW IMPACT: Modification to offboarding description field logic affects critical HR deprovisioning workflows—risks breaking LDAP listener triggers parsing description text for workflow routing, Exchange/O365 mailbox delegation removal automation dependent on description field values, downstream HR systems consuming description data for identity management platforms, and audit/compliance reporting extracting description patterns for offboarding validation and SOX compliance.",
      "HIGH - TEMPLATE INACTIVE AND UNPUBLISHED: Template shows inactive status (active: false) and unpublished state (published_ref: empty) despite 100% success rate across 505 changes. Template last updated 2025-11-05 but remains inactive/unpublished, suggesting deprecated status or ongoing review. Questionable whether template should be used for new changes without platform owner confirmation.",
      "MEDIUM - CMDB ENVIRONMENT UNDEFINED: CMDB CI 'ServiceNow - Production' has undefined environment field (environment: empty), creating classification gap and preventing proper impact assessment for production deployment.",
      "MEDIUM - NO WORKFLOW ATTACHMENT: Template shows no workflow attachment (workflow: empty, template_has_workflow: false) despite being designated for standard changes, creating procedural inconsistency for change automation."
    ],
    "required_actions": [
      "MANDATORY: DO NOT PROCEED - Change shows CLOSED status since 2025-04-30. Clarify evaluation context: if revalidating historical change, document reason and current production state; if data error, correct change state before CAB review; if record reuse, create new change record per protocol.",
      "MANDATORY: Resolve clone data availability - Collection_errors indicates 'Clone info unavailable for target instance mobizuat'. Establish clone freshness verification for target instance or document alternative environment validation approach.",
      "MANDATORY: Document comprehensive rollback plan including: (1) exact update set revert procedure with sys_ids (currently lists: '2c15e8eac3452a10ad36b9ff05013109,0015a8eac3452a10ad36b9ff0501316e'), (2) description field value restoration steps, (3) validation checklist for offboarding workflow functionality, (4) estimated rollback duration, (5) post-rollback testing requirements.",
      "MANDATORY: Create detailed test plan covering: (1) HR offboarding request submission with shared mailbox component, (2) description field population for 'Revoke Access' vs 'Fulfill Access' scenarios, (3) workflow trigger validation for mailbox delegation removal, (4) end-to-end offboarding for multiple user types, (5) integration testing with Exchange/LDAP systems, (6) regression testing for non-offboarding shared mailbox requests.",
      "MANDATORY: Expand implementation plan to specify: (1) exact update set names/sys_ids ('SR; AllCare offboarding request', 'SR; AllCare Update User Cat Item'), (2) deployment sequence and dependencies, (3) affected catalog items/workflows, (4) estimated installation duration, (5) pre-deployment environment snapshot procedure.",
      "REQUIRED: Confirm template validity - Template 'ServiceNow Platform Updates - 20' shows inactive (active: false) and unpublished status. Obtain platform owner confirmation that template is approved for use or activate/publish template before proceeding.",
      "REQUIRED: Define CMDB CI environment - Update CMDB CI 'ServiceNow - Production' (sys_id: 73a10e0b87e8e910e88deb5e0ebb3578) to include environment classification (currently empty).",
      "REQUIRED: Add comprehensive justification explaining business impact of current incorrect descriptions, stakeholder approval from HR leadership, and urgency rationale beyond current statement.",
      "REQUIRED: Define communication plan to notify HR team of corrected description behavior including validation period and escalation contacts.",
      "RECOMMENDED: Document dependent systems review (Exchange integration, LDAP listeners, identity management platforms) to assess downstream impact of description field changes."
    ],
    "synthesis": "REJECT - Change CHG0041590 cannot proceed to CAB approval due to critical disqualifying conditions: (1) change record shows CLOSED state since 2025-04-30 yet being evaluated 2025-11-08 (context required before assessment), (2) clone data unavailable for target instance 'mobizuat' preventing environment readiness verification, (3) no actionable rollback or test plans provided, (4) template inactive/unpublished despite 100% historical success rate, (5) CMDB environment undefined. Documentation quality falls catastrophically below the standard demonstrated by template's 505 successful changes. Required remediation: clarify closed change context, establish environment validation, complete mandatory rollback/test plans, confirm template validity, define CMDB environment classification. Recommend requester collaborate with platform owner to address all deficiencies and resubmit with complete documentation meeting organizational quality standards."
