    "documentation_assessment": "CRITICAL DOCUMENTATION FAILURES: This change exhibits fundamental deficiencies that violate production deployment standards. Implementation plan ('Install Update sets') lacks deployment sequence, specific component identification (despite u_update_set field listing 'SR; AllCare offboarding request' and 'SR; AllCare Update User Cat Item'), duration estimates, and pre-deployment validation steps. While backout_plan contains 'Backout Update sets', this provides no actionable recovery procedure—missing update set sys_ids, revert sequence, validation checkpoints, or rollback duration estimates. NO test plan provided (test_plan field empty), eliminating visibility into validation scope, test scenarios executed, or acceptance criteria. Justification states desired outcome but omits business impact analysis, stakeholder authorization evidence, urgency rationale, or cost of inaction. Most critically: change state shows CLOSED since 2025-04-30 (closed_at: 2025-04-30 09:32:01, close_code: successful, state: 3) with work completed 6+ months ago, yet automated validation runs occurred 2025-11-07/08. This indicates either post-implementation audit, data integrity issue, improper change record reuse, or failed rollback requiring reassessment—context must be established before any CAB evaluation proceeds.",

      "CRITICAL: Change record shows CLOSED state (state: 3, closed_at: 2025-04-30 09:32:01, close_code: successful) yet being evaluated 2025-11-08—6+ months post-closure. This indicates either: (1) retroactive audit of implemented change, (2) data corruption/integrity issue, (3) improper record reuse for new work, or (4) failed rollback requiring reassessment. Context must be established before CAB review—if change already deployed, production state analysis required; if record error, correct state before evaluation; if reusing closed records, this violates change management protocol.",
      "CRITICAL: Clone freshness check returns 'not_found' with no clone record for target instance 'mobizuat'—unable to verify environment readiness. Collection_errors indicates 'Clone info unavailable for target instance (no recent clone record)'. Prior validation notes reference 554-day clone age (18.4 months stale) for 'mobizdev' instance. This creates unacceptable deployment risk as environment drift between development/UAT and production cannot be assessed. Without clone data, cannot confirm update sets developed against current production schema.",
      "CRITICAL: Zero rollback plan beyond generic 'Backout Update sets' statement eliminates recovery path if deployment corrupts HR offboarding workflows, breaks mailbox access revocation triggers in Exchange/O365 integrations, or introduces description field logic errors affecting active offboarding tickets. Without specific update set revert procedures (sys_ids, sequence), validation steps, and rollback duration estimates, production recovery capability is compromised for critical HR deprovisioning automation.",
      "HIGH: Empty test plan (test_plan field null) means validation approach completely unknown—no evidence that HR offboarding scenarios, shared mailbox revocation workflows, description field population logic, LDAP deprovisioning triggers, or Exchange mailbox delegation removal automation were tested before production deployment (if already deployed) or are planned for testing (if pending deployment). Template shows 100% success rate across 505 changes, but this submission falls significantly below that quality standard.",
      "HIGH: Modification to offboarding description field logic affects critical HR deprovisioning workflows—risks breaking LDAP listener triggers that parse description text for workflow routing, Exchange/O365 mailbox delegation removal automation dependent on description field values, downstream HR systems consuming description data for identity management platforms, or audit/compliance reporting extracting description patterns for offboarding validation and SOX compliance.",
      "HIGH: Update set deployment to production without confirmed environment refresh risks installing code developed against outdated schema, missing dependencies introduced in intervening platform updates, conflicting with recent customizations to shared mailbox catalog items, or overwriting production hotfixes applied since development began. Target instance 'mobizuat' clone status unknown creates blind deployment scenario.",
      "MEDIUM: Template shows inactive status (active: false) and unpublished state (template_is_published: false) despite 100% success rate across 505 closed changes—suggests template deprecated or under review. Template last updated 2025-11-05 (3 days ago) but remains inactive/unpublished. Questionable whether"

    "documentation_assessment": "CHG0041592 exhibits catastrophic documentation failures and fraudulent template misuse that constitute governance bypass. This change is classified under 'ServiceNow Platform Updates' standard template while implementing expense management application configuration—specifically routing PAK currency expenses from Accounting to HR and deactivating PDF generation logic. The update set name 'AZ;STRY0011125;Expense Item - sc_task routing + deactivate PDFs generation' and description 'Expense Item Routing - When currency is PAK - ticket should go to Human Resources instead of Accounting & deactive logic to generate PDFs' explicitly confirm this is application logic modification, not platform maintenance. Implementation plan marked 'N/A' despite requiring business rule modifications, workflow routing changes, and configuration updates. Rollback plan completely absent—mandatory for financial workflow changes affecting audit trails and SOX compliance. Test plan marked 'N/A' for changes impacting expense processing and downstream integrations. Justification 'Requested by Igor' provides zero business case, urgency rationale, stakeholder alignment, or compliance consideration. Template producer inactive (active: false) indicates this template should not accept new changes. Most concerning: change state '3' (Closed) with 'Successful' close code dated April 24, 2025, yet contains four automated rejection work notes from November 7-8, 2025—clear evidence of governance bypass or unauthorized reactivation attempt without remediation.",
    "risks": [
      "CRITICAL: No clone freshness data available for mobizuat target instance—'not_found' status makes environment validation impossible and configuration drift risk unquantifiable",
      "CRITICAL: Template misclassification bypasses appropriate change controls—'Platform Updates' template has fundamentally different risk profile, review requirements, and approval thresholds than financial application logic modifications",
      "CRITICAL: Expense routing change from Accounting to HR for PAK currency creates unvalidated workflow disruption affecting financial processes, approval chains, SLA compliance, organizational accountability, segregation of duties, and financial controls without documented testing or stakeholder approval",
      "CRITICAL: PDF generation deactivation may break downstream systems consuming expense documentation including ERP integrations, audit systems, compliance repositories, reporting tools, reimbursement processing, tax documentation, and regulatory filing systems—no integration endpoint analysis performed",
      "CRITICAL: Zero rollback plan means inability to restore routing logic or PDF functionality when business disruption occurs—unacceptable for financial operations with potential SOX, audit trail, and regulatory compliance implications",
      "HIGH: HR team readiness unconfirmed—no evidence of capacity planning, training, process documentation, system access provisioning, workload impact analysis, or approval delegation setup for handling PAK currency expenses",
      "HIGH: Accounting team impact unexplored—workload reduction/reallocation, handoff procedures, system access adjustments, process documentation updates, and financial controls modifications not addressed",
      "HIGH: Compliance and audit implications unassessed—currency-specific routing may violate financial controls, segregation of duties principles, regulatory requirements (SOX 404), or audit trail integrity requirements",
      "HIGH: Integration cascade failures likely—financial reporting systems, expense analytics platforms, compliance systems, data warehouses, and third-party applications consuming PDF outputs not identified, tested, or notified",
